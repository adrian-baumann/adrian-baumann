I am a dedicated Data Analyst with a background in physics. I am all about getting the most out of your data and building a nice visualization for good communication!

Maybe you want to have a look at these:
- [A explorative analysis I have done with Mein Grundeinkommen e.V.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adrian-baumann/basic-income-explorative-analysis/blob/master/analysis.ipynb?flush_cache=false)
- [A visualization of pi inspired by Nadieh Bremer](https://github.com/adrian-baumann/visualizing_pi)
