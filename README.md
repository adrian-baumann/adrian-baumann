### Hi, I'm Adrian ðŸ‘‹
___
I'm a Senior Data Analyst with technical experience at an AI-based company transitioning into analytics engineering.

In my current role, I develop and own several internal tools based on large and complex databases to automate and simplify operational tasks for my team. These projects involve a lot of communication and alignment with stakeholders, as well as scripting, data quality improvements, data modeling, and pipeline building. Mostly in Python, AWS Athena, PostgreSQL and Airflow. Â 

Previously, I worked at a German non-profit organization where I built their ETL pipeline and implemented Tableau as a BI solution.

Have a look at some of my projects:
- [A explorative analysis I have done with Mein Grundeinkommen e.V.](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/adrian-baumann/basic-income-explorative-analysis/blob/master/analysis.ipynb)
- [A visualization of pi inspired by Nadieh Bremer](https://github.com/adrian-baumann/visualizing_pi)
